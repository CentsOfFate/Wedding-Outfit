## Colors
The Official Colors for the wedding will be:
* White
* Navy
* Burgandy
* Walnut

![alt text](http://blog.stylishwedd.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/navy-blue-burgundy-and-peach-autumn-wedding-colors.jpg)

The reason for this is that all these colors match really well with each other, especially for the beginning of the Fall Season. Mid-October is right when all the trees are solidly turning colors with yellow, red and brown hues. The White and Navy is a younger, trendier color combination while the Burgandy and Walnut will complement the season with their warm overtones.

A couple Examples of this color combination:

* [Example 4](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5a/f8/65/5af865ba8f9294207f22b8304a4103bc.jpg)

My recommendation for the wedding (Groomsman Required, Guests Optional, but Recommended)
* Navy Suit
* White Dress Shirt - Spread Collar Recommended
* Navy OR Burgandy Tie - Solid and Wool. Patterned is fine, but don't go Silk, more on this later
* White Pocket Square
* Walnut/Tan Oxfords - Plain or Brogues are fine, more on this later

## Shopping List for Official Colors

### Navy Suit

Budget Tier:
[Stafford Suit Jacket](https://www.jcpenney.com/p/stafford-travel-wool-blend-stretch-classic-fit-suit-jacket/ppr5007160380?pTmplType=regular&catId=SearchResults&searchTerm=Stafford+Suit&productGridView=medium&N=270&badge=onlyatjcp%7Ccollection) and [Stafford Suit Pants](https://www.jcpenney.com/p/stafford-travel-wool-blend-stretch-flat-front-suit-pants-classic-fit/ppr5007193643?pTmplType=regular&enrId=enr5007160392)

God Tier:
[Suit Supply](https://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/suits/napoli-navy-plain/P5229MI.html?cgid=Suits&prefn1=colorID&prefn2=fit&prefv1=blue&prefv2=Napoli%7CSienna)

JCPenney's Stafford Suit offering is not too shabby for the price. The fit isn't super perfect, but I wouldn't expect that for a Sub $200 Suit. Suit Supply is awesome, if you want to shell out $400. I'm don't know too many brands in the ~$200 range, so I could use some help to help identify a brand.

### White Dress Shirt

Budget Tier:
* [Stafford](https://www.jcpenney.com/p/stafford-travel-easy-care-broadcloth-dress-shirt/pp5003521148?pTmplType=regular&catId=cat100240025&deptId=dept20000014&urlState=/g/mens-shirts/N-bwo3yD1nohp5Z7i&sort=BS&productGridView=medium&badge=onlyatjcp)
* [Target](https://www.target.com/p/men-s-slim-fit-button-down-dress-shirt-goodfellow-co-153/-/A-52492012?preselect=52377256#lnk=sametab)

Best Bang for your Buck Tier:
* [Amazon's Brand](https://www.amazon.com/Buttoned-Down-Fitted-Spread-Collar-Non-Iron/dp/B01IOY5832/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1529279921&sr=8-7&keywords=Buttoned+Down) - What I will be wearing
* [Nordstorm](https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/nordstrom-mens-shop-trim-fit-non-iron-solid-dress-shirt/4002995?origin=category-personalizedsort&fashioncolor=WHITE&cm_mmc=Linkshare-_-partner-_-10-_-1&siteId=th9ILo5LtqE-McZccvR2Ns7c81Ioin5aDg)

God-Tier:
* [Brooks Brothers](https://www.brooksbrothers.com/Regent-Fitted-Dress-Shirt%2C-Non-Iron-Point-Collar/224Q,default,pd.html?dwvar_224Q_Color=WHIT&contentpos=2&cgid=0203)
* [Ledbury](https://www.ledbury.com/collections/dress-shirts/products/white-fine-twill-mid-spread-dress-shirt?variant=33457070281&utm_source=idev&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=dappered)

All of these Dress Shirts are all good quality shirts. Naturally, the more you spend, the better Dress Shirt you will get. These, in my opinion, are going to be best brands you can buy at the price range. Stafford and Target will get the job done, and nobody is going to judge you for having Polyster in your shirt. Amazon's Buttoned Down Brand and Nordstorm's Dress Shirt are extremely good for the price. They are definitely worth the extra dollars if you want a Dress Shirt that you will want to wear even after the wedding. I have worn Brooks Brother's Dress Shirts before, and they are the real deal. The Shirts are silky smooth and you feel like you are the owner of a large bank when you wear one.

I recommend Spread Collar for the wedding, since this is a formal occasion. Spread Collar will "complete" the suit by having all the sharp lines be in the right places. See this [Example](http://hespokestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/navy-suit-windowpane-spread-collar-shirt-blue-striped-tie-oxblood-shoes-business-wedding-outfit-idea-men-8-800x533.jpg). The Spread with the tie gives the sharp line style that makes you look stronger and more masculine. Compare that with this [Example](https://i.dmarge.com/2015/08/Tab-Collar.jpg). Point Collar doesn't have as sharp of a look, and looks less formal. Since this is a wedding, go Spread Collar.

### Navy or Burgandy Tie/White Pocket Square

ONLY Tier:
* [Tie Bar - Navy](https://www.thetiebar.com/product/20902)
* [Tie Bar - Burgandy](https://www.thetiebar.com/product/22429) - What I will be wearing
* [Tie Bar - Pocket Square](https://www.thetiebar.com/product/PS062) - What I will be wearing

WOOL! The season is going to be Fall, so going wool is going to make you look really sharp. Don't go silk if you can't help it. The weather outside is going to be faded colors and the shininess of silk is going to make you look out of place. The warmth and unassuming nature of wool is going make you look better, I promise you.

White Pocket Square is a great neutral color, and will match with a White Dress Shirt. It helps pull together the look.

Tie Bar is awesome. Their ties are $20 for a great quality tie. Go 3 Inches for the size of the tie.

### Walnut Dress Shoes

Budget Tier:
* [JCPenney](https://www.jcpenney.com/p/product/pp5003861327?pTmplType=regular)

Best Bang for your Buck Tier:
* [Johnston and Murphy](https://www.johnstonmurphy.com/conard-cap-toe/9488.html?dwvar_9488_color=Tan%20Italian%20Calfskin) - What I will be wearing

God Tier:
* [Allen Edmonds](https://www.allenedmonds.com/shoes/mens-shoes/oxford-derby-shoes/strand-cap-toe-oxford/SF1635.html?dwvar_SF1635_color=1635)

JCPenny and J&M would be great. Try to go for a Dress Shoe that's a solid Walnut/Tan color like [this](https://www.styleforum.net/content/type/61/id/1251657/width/200/height/400/flags/LL). The striking Walnut shoe will go perfectly for the fall season. Allen Edmonds, although unbelievable in quality, is going to be a lot to ask for at a $400 retail price. J&M strike a good price point for quality though.

In terms of Dress Shoe type, it doesn't really matter. Plain Oxford, Cap Toe, Half Wingtips, Full Wingtips are all fine. Single or Double Monkstraps are fashion forward, and I won't be opposed to them. Boat Shoes and Penny Loafers won't be allowed.

Overall:

* Budget Tier: Around $250 for all the Budget Tier Items

If you had to buy everything from scratch for the Budget Tier for this wedding, you're total cost would be $250 to own everything. That's is not that shabby to be honest. Everything in the Budget Tier are decent quality items that will go great in your wardrobe even after the wedding.
