# Wedding Outfit Repository for Charlie x Ryne Wedding October 2019

## Colors
The colors for the wedding will be:
* White
* Navy
* Burgandy
* Walnut

The reason for this is that all these colors match really well with each other, especially for the beginning of the Fall Season. Mid-October is right when all the trees are solidly turning colors with yellow, red and brown hues. The White and Navy is a younger, trendier color combination while the Burgandy and Walnut will complement the season with their warm overtones.

A couple Examples of this color combination:

* [Example 4](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/5a/f8/65/5af865ba8f9294207f22b8304a4103bc.jpg)

My recommendation for the wedding (Groomsman Required, Guests Optional, but Recommended)
* Navy Suit
* White Dress Shirt - Spread Collar
* Navy OR Burgandy Tie - Solid and Wool. Not Patterned or Silk. More on this later
* Walnut/Tan Oxfords - Plain or Brogues are fine. More on this later
