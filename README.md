# Wedding Outfit Repository for Charlie x Ryne Wedding October 2019

## Colors
The colors for the wedding will be:
* White
* Navy
* Burgandy
* Walnut

The reason for this is that all these colors match really well with each other, especially for the beginning of the Fall Season. Mid-October is right when all the trees are solidly turning colors with yellow, red and brown hues. The White and Navy is a younger color combination while the Burgandy and Walnut will complement the season with their warm overtones.
